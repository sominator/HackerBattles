text = "Entromancy: Hacker Battles is a competitive card game based on creating and deploying programs, which are in turn comprised of functions, represented by cards.

Each round of Entromancy: Hacker Battles is divided into three phases: Initialize {}, Compile {}, and Execute {}.  Each player takes a turn within each  phase before the game moves on to the next phase.

During the Initialize {} phase, each player is dealt 5 functions from the top of the deck, creating a hand.

During the Compile {} phase, each player creates a program by playing functions one at a time from their hand, face up, from left to right in their playing area.

During the Execute {} phase, all BP accrual or depletion is resolved, to a minimum of 0.

Each player has five function sockets, into which they play their functions, from left to right, on their turns.  Each socket has a value, from 1 to 5, beginning with the leftmost socket (1) and ending with the rightmost socket (5).  

Placing a function into a socket makes the function active.  A player can also flip a card (shift + click) to play an inactive function.

If  a player reaches 20 BP, they have overcome the other playersâ€™ security device and won the Hacker Battle.  If more than one player reaches  20 BP at the same time, the game continues until one player accrues a total of more BP than the other.

There are 15 unique functions in the full game, and two copies of each function included in each deck, for a total of 60 cards.
 
The full game also includes 5 different Objective cards and 5 unique Hacker Specializations that utilize variables to dramatically affect the game.
